        <h1>Timeline</h1>
        <p class="bi">In 1564, Galileo Galilei was born in Pisa, Italy. Though he initially
                studied medicine, his passion shifted to mathematics and physics. By 1589, he
                secured a professorship at the University of Pisa, where he challenged traditional
                ideas with his experiments.  Galileo's revolutionary telescope, built in 1609, led
                 to groundbreaking astronomical discoveries like Jupiter's moons. His support for the
                 heliocentric model clashed with the Church's teachings, resulting in an inquisition in 1633, 
                forcing him to spend his remaining years under house arrest. Despite these challenges,
                Galileo's scientific legacy and contributions remain a cornerstone of modern science.</p>
        <h2>About Galileo Galilei</h2>
        <ul class="facts-list">
            <li>He was a polymath: astronomer, physicist, engineer, mathematician, philosopher, and inventor.</li>
            <li>He improved the telescope's design, leading to groundbreaking astronomical discoveries.</li>
            <li>He discovered the four largest moons of Jupiter (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto).</li>
            <li>He supported the heliocentric model (Sun-centered) and faced the Inquisition for it.</li>
            <li>He observed the phases of Venus, which challenged the geocentric model (Earth-centered).</li>
            <li>He made significant contributions to the field of mechanics.</li>
            <li>He was nearly blind at the end of his life, but his work inspired future scientists.</li>
